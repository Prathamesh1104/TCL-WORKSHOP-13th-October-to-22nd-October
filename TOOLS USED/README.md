# VSD Workshop Tools Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of all the tools used in the VSD – TCL Programming for Synthesis & STA Automation workshop. The tools covered are:

- Yosys  
- OpenTimer  
- Netgen  
- Qrouter  
- Magic  

These tools form an end-to-end, open-source VLSI design flow, spanning RTL synthesis to STA, routing, and layout verification.

# 🧠 Yosys – Open Source RTL Synthesis Tool

Yosys is an open-source RTL synthesis framework that plays a crucial role in digital design automation (EDA). It converts high-level hardware description language (HDL) code — typically **Verilog** — into **gate-level netlists** suitable for implementation in FPGAs or ASICs. Yosys is the foundation of the open-source hardware synthesis flow and is frequently used with tools like **OpenTimer, Netgen, Qrouter,** and **Magic**.

---

## Overview

Yosys provides a complete set of commands for reading, elaborating, optimizing, and synthesizing HDL code. It supports **RTL-to-gate synthesis**, **technology mapping**, and **custom scripting through TCL**.  

It is particularly valuable for:
- FPGA design prototyping  
- ASIC design synthesis  
- Teaching and research in VLSI  
- Integration in open-source EDA flows (e.g., OpenLANE, Qflow)

## Key Features

### 1. RTL Parsing
- Reads Verilog HDL files and constructs an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.  
- Supports structural and behavioral Verilog.  
- Handles parameterized modules, generates blocks, and performs hierarchy resolution.

### 2. Elaboration
- Expands module instances and parameters.
- Builds a fully connected design hierarchy for analysis and synthesis.

### 3. Logic Synthesis
- Translates high-level logic into **generic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, DFF, etc.)**.  
- Supports multiple synthesis passes, such as:
  - `proc` – process extraction  
  - `opt` – logic optimization  
  - `fsm` – finite state machine extraction and optimization  
  - `memory` – RAM/ROM inference and mapping  

### 4. Optimization
- Constant propagation and dead-code elimination.  
- Logic simplification and redundant gate removal.  
- Timing-driven optimization via constraints.  

### 5. Technology Mapping
- Maps generic logic to **target standard cells** using **Liberty (`.lib`) files**.  
- Produces a gate-level netlist compatible with backend tools like OpenTimer or Magic.

### 6. Netlist Generation
- Exports the synthesized design to formats like:
  - **Verilog (.v)**
  - **BLIF**
  - **EDIF**
- Provides human-readable synthesis logs and statistics.

## Typical Yosys Workflow

The Yosys synthesis flow consists of several automated stages:

```text
Verilog Source (.v)
     ↓
[read_verilog]
     ↓
Elaboration (proc, flatten)
     ↓
Optimization (opt, fsm, memory)
     ↓
Technology Mapping (abc, techmap)
     ↓
Netlist Generation (write_verilog)

---

## Example:

```tcl
# TCL Automation for Yosys Synthesis
set DesignName "alu"
set OutputDirectory "./output"
set NetlistDirectory "./netlist"
set LateLibraryPath "./lib/sky130.lib"

# Create Yosys script dynamically
set ys_file "$OutputDirectory/$DesignName.ys"
set fid [open $ys_file w]

# Load the Liberty library
puts $fid "read_liberty -lib ${LateLibraryPath}"

# Load all Verilog design files
foreach f [glob -dir $NetlistDirectory *.v] {
    puts $fid "read_verilog $f"
}

# Run synthesis
puts $fid "synth -top $DesignName"
puts $fid "write_verilog $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.synth.v"

close $fid

# Execute Yosys
exec yosys -s $ys_file
